# Virtual Study Buddy Finder (VSBF)
Welcome to VSBF, where in these challenging times you have the ability to find people to study with.
# Functionality
Along the top of the page, you'll see a whole host of buttons with links that will lead you to the different parts of our app.
We use google authentication to allow you to create an account and therefore a profile in our platform.
The home page gives you some of the top stories from the New York Times, in order to inform you of the conditions of the times.
Our app allows you to not only find one-time study buddies, but to also form "clans" which is our unique way of organizing your teams.
We also have a full top stories page, where our users have access to more NYT  health articles for more information on how we can work responsibly in these trying times.
